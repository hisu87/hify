## ✨ What is Hify?

Hify is a **self-hosted web app** that downloads music from Spotify — without touching the Spotify API, without needing an account, and without any Premium subscription. Just drop a link and get a fully-tagged audio file.

It resolves track metadata directly from Spotify's public embed pages, finds the best audio match on YouTube Music, downloads it with `yt-dlp`, converts it with `ffmpeg`, and embeds album art + all metadata with `mutagen`. The entire pipeline runs inside a single Docker container.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name hify \
  -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
  -v hify_data:/data \
  ghcr.io/hisu87/hify
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), paste a Spotify link, and hit download.

> Change `/path/to/downloads` to wherever you want your music saved.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  hify:
    container_name: hify
    image: ghcr.io/hisu87/hify:latest
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      - ./downloads:/downloads
      - hify_data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  hify_data:
```

Need a custom port? Use the `HIFY_PORT` environment variable:

```yaml

## ⚙️ How It Works

Hify's download pipeline has three stages:

```
Spotify embed page  →  YouTube Music search  →  yt-dlp + ffmpeg + mutagen
   (metadata)             (audio match)            (download & tag)
```

1. **Metadata** — Track, album and playlist links are resolved by scraping the public `open.spotify.com/embed` pages. No Spotify credentials of any kind are required.
2. **Audio match** — [`ytmusicapi`](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/) searches YouTube Music for the track and picks the best result by comparing audio duration. Free-text searches skip the Spotify step entirely.
3. **Download & tag** — [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) downloads the audio and `ffmpeg` converts it to your chosen format. [`mutagen`](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/) embeds title, artist, album, year and cover art into the file.

## 👁️ Playlist Monitor

The **Playlist Monitor** lets Hify watch your favorite Spotify playlists and automatically download any new songs added to them — hands-free.

**How to use it:**

1. Click the eye icon (👁) in the navigation bar
2. Paste a Spotify playlist URL
3. Choose how often Hify should check for new tracks (every 15 min up to once a day)
4. Click **Watch**

From that point on, whenever a new song appears in the playlist on Spotify, Hify will detect and download it on the next scheduled check. Tracks that were already in the playlist when you added it are skipped — only *new* additions are downloaded.

You can pause, resume, force an immediate check, or stop monitoring any playlist at any time from the same page.

## 🎛️ Download Settings

Access the settings panel (⚙️ icon) to configure:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Output format** | MP3 · FLAC · M4A · OGG · OPUS |
| **Bitrate** | 128 · 192 · 256 · 320 kbps (ignored for FLAC) |
| **Audio provider** | YouTube Music |
| **Organize by artist** | Off (default) · On |

### 📁 Organize by artist

When **Settings → File organization → Organize by artist** is enabled, every downloaded track is saved inside a subfolder named after the track's primary artist:

```
<downloads>/
  Arctic Monkeys/
    Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know.mp3
    Arctic Monkeys - R U Mine.mp3
  Tame Impala/
    Tame Impala - The Less I Know The Better.mp3
```

This applies to **all** downloads — single tracks, albums and playlists alike. Playlist tracks are saved in their artist's folder instead of a playlist folder, which makes the library compatible with media apps (like Jellyfin, Navidrome, Plex and Beets) that expect an `Artist/Song.ext` folder structure.

When the setting is **off** (default), the existing behaviour is preserved: single tracks go directly into the root of the downloads folder, and playlist tracks go into a per-playlist subfolder.

> **M3U files and playlists** — If you download a Spotify playlist with both *Organize by artist* and *Generate M3U* enabled, the M3U file is placed in `<downloads>/Playlists/<playlist-name>.m3u` (rather than inside the playlist subfolder) because the tracks are now spread across multiple artist folders. The relative paths inside the M3U still resolve correctly regardless of where you mount the library.

## 📦 What Spotify links are supported?

| Link type | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| Spotify track | ✅ |
| Spotify album | ✅ |
| Spotify playlist | ✅ |
| YouTube Music search (free text) | ✅ |
| Direct YouTube link | ✅ |

---

## 📃 M3U playlist export

Hify writes a standard `EXTM3U` file alongside your audio whenever a playlist gets downloaded — both for **manual** playlist paste-downloads and for **Playlist Monitor** sweeps that fetched at least one new track:

```
<downloads>/Playlists/<playlist-name>.m3u
```

The behaviour is governed by a single toggle in **Settings → Playlists → Generate M3U file for playlists** (on by default). Flip it off if you'd rather not produce M3Us at all; the rest of the download flow is unchanged.

Tracks that failed to download or had no YouTube Music match are skipped (and logged). The M3U is regenerated fresh on every run, so re-pasting the same playlist URL — or letting the Monitor add new tracks over time — always produces a complete, in-order file.

Track paths inside the M3U are written **relative to the M3U file itself**, so the same file works whether it's read from inside Hify (where the library is mounted at `/downloads`) or from another consumer that mounts the same library at a different root — e.g. Jellyfin under `/nas/music`. Just point your media server at the same library mount and the playlist will appear as a single unit instead of a pile of loose files.

## 🎧 Built-in Player

Hify ships with a clean web player so you don't need a separate app to listen to what you've downloaded. Open the headphones icon (🎧) in the navigation bar — or hit the play button next to any file in the **Library** — and Hify will load every audio file from your downloads folder into a queue.

**What's included:**

- Big now-playing card with embedded **album art** and a progress bar (click or drag to seek)
- Play / pause / previous / next
- **Shuffle** with a stable random order across the whole queue
- **Repeat** modes: off → all → one
- Volume slider with mute toggle (volume is remembered between sessions)
- Side queue listing every track in your library, each one with its own thumbnail and the currently playing one highlighted

The player parses `Artist - Title.ext` filenames so the now-playing card shows artist and title nicely, and pulls the cover art directly from the audio file's embedded tags (the same artwork Hify wrote at download time). Playback uses your browser's native HTML5 audio element — no extra dependencies, no extra processes.

## 🌍 Internationalization

Hify's UI is fully translatable. The default language is **English**, with **Spanish** and **Brazilian Portuguese** included out of the box. You can switch languages from **Settings → Language**; your choice is saved in the browser's `localStorage` and applied instantly without a reload.

### Contributing translations

Adding a new language is a small, three-step change — no build tooling beyond the existing Vite setup is required.

1. **Copy the English file as a starting point.** Locale files live in `frontend/src/i18n/locales/`. Each file exports a single object whose keys match the structure of `en.js` exactly. Pick an [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) for the file name (e.g. `fr.js`, `de.js`, `it.js`, `ja.js`, `pt-PT.js`).

   ```bash
   cp frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.js frontend/src/i18n/locales/fr.js
   ```

2. **Translate the values.** Keep the keys, the placeholder tokens (e.g. `{count}`, `{name}`, `{file}`) and the overall shape unchanged — only the strings on the right-hand side should change. Update the `language.name` field at the top of the file to the **native** name of the language ("Français", "Deutsch", "Italiano"…) — this is the label that appears in the language picker.

3. **Register the locale** in `frontend/src/i18n/index.js`:

   ```js
   import fr from './locales/fr.js'

   export const AVAILABLE_LOCALES = [
     { code: 'en', name: 'English', messages: en },
     { code: 'es', name: 'Español', messages: es },
     { code: 'pt-BR', name: 'Português (BR)', messages: ptBR },
     { code: 'fr', name: 'Français', messages: fr }, // new entry
   ]
   ```

That's it. Rebuild the frontend (`cd frontend && npm run build`) — your language will show up in **Settings → Language** automatically.

**Tips for translators:**

- Missing keys fall back to English, so partial translations still ship. You can submit a PR with only the strings you're confident about.
- Placeholder tokens like `{count}` or `{file}` must be left as-is — they're substituted at runtime.
- Keep strings concise: the UI is laid out tightly and very long translations may wrap awkwardly. If you need to rephrase to fit, that's fine.
- After translating, run `npm run dev` from `frontend/` and click through every page in your language to spot anything that overflows or reads oddly in context.

Pull requests with new translations are very welcome — just open a PR against `main`.
