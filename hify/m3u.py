"""Build and write Jellyfin-compatible ``.m3u`` playlist files.

The Spotify embed flow gives us the playlist name and an ordered list of
tracks; the downloader gives us the final on-disk filename of every
track that succeeds. Combining the two produces an ``EXTM3U`` file that
Jellyfin (and any other media server that consumes M3U) can pick up so
the playlist appears as a single unit instead of a pile of loose tracks.
